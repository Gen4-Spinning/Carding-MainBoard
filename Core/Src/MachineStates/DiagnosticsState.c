	 * open loop. Though the app allows distance from 1 - 280, if you move one side by more than 4 mm
	 * the lift relative error automatically will stop the motor.
	 *
	 * for lift both, if you have a small distance, say less than 5 mm, then automatically this code
	 * selects a very slow speed, 1mm/sec and sends the closed loop speed. Otherwise the speed is
	 * 2mm/sec for distances greater
	 *
	 * lift relative error is always on. if the stop commands doesnt get the ack the SMPS is switched
	 * off. Pressing stop on the switch box also sends the stop command immediately, and again
	 * if ack is not recieved , smps is switched off.
	 *
	 * if response is 2 for a setup msg, we just need to send a msg to the app , with some error.
